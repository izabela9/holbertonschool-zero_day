# HolbertonSchool Zero Day Project

This is my first project with Git. This project is about basic commands we will need for using Git in our previous projects. 

## Installation

If git is not already installed on your terminal:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

## Make your first repository 
Using the graphic interface on the github website, create your first repository.
* Name
* Description
* Public Repo

Next we copy this repository to our terminal with creating a directory with the same name

```python
mdkir <nameoftherepository>

```

## Key commands in our project 

```python
git add
git commit 
git push 
```
This commands are used to add our changes in terminal in Git.
Another key commands are :
```python
git branch 
git checkout
git pull 
```
We used **git branch Name** to create a branch which is a version of your repository, or in other words, an independent line of development. A repository can contain multiple branches, which means there are multiple versions of the repository.  
We used **git branch** to see in which branch are we in.  
We used **git checkout new_branch** to switch branches.  
We used **git pull** command to fetch and download content from the remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
